# Exercise Set 1

  - Exercise 1: the required program must
    - count (and show the binary counter on the output LEDs) from 0 to **x** and from **x** to 0, alternately, where x is input from the 4 LSB switches (x âˆˆ [0...15]).
    - This must happen while the input switch MSB is ON, otherwise the program must wait for the MSB to be turned on.
    - The timer limit **x** can receive input changes only when the counter is 0.
