# Exercise Set 1

  - Exercise 1: the required program must count (and show the binary counter on the output LEDs) from 0 to **x** and from **x** to 0, where x is a number given as an input from the 4 LSB switches(x âˆˆ [0...15]). This must be happening while the input switch MSB is ON, otherwise the program must wait for the MSB to be turned on. The timer limit **x** can receive input changes only when the counter is 0.
